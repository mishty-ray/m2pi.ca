**July 11-29, 2022**

In July 2022 PIMS is holding a virtual workshop called Math to Power
Industry(M2PI 2022) which will run from July 11 - 29. We are currently inviting
non-academic partner organizations to consider participation in this workshop.

### How it works
 
* Organizations are invited to submit math challenges for teams of graduate
  students and postdoctoral fellows to tackle during the workshop.
* PIMS matches your company to an academic researcher who can provide support
  for developing the problem statement.
* Companies provide an industry mentor to work closely with the team during the
  workshop for a minimum of two hours per day during the last 10 days of the
  workshop.  Industry mentors are welcome to work more closely with the team if
  desired.
* During the workshop our graduate student and postdoc participants will also
  receive professional and technical skills training relevant to STEM careers in
  industry.
* Efforts will be made to link companies to talent during and beyond the
  workshop to explore internships and other hiring needs.

The intended outcome is that companies will have the opportunity to engage with
highly skilled talent, while also receiving innovative solutions to the math
challenge submitted to the workshop. You can see examples of successful
projects on this website.

We ask that industry partners who would like to explore participating in the
Math^Industry Workshop please fill this short [Industry Partner
Survey](https://survey.ucalgary.ca/jfe/form/SV_41SJsq6pqN7gOzk).

 If you have questions please contact the workshop's Industry Co-Director, Dr.
Kristine Bauer at industry@pims.math.ca. We look forward to hearing from you.
