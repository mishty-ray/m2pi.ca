**August 3-27, 2021**

Together with our partners, [PIMS](https://www.pims.math.ca) is excited to offer
a 4-week virtual Math<sup>Industry</sup> workshop for graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows in the mathematical and statistical sciences to gain
the industry skills needed for success in their careers.

This workshop has two main objectives:

1. To build technical skills in programming and computational workflows
2. To build business skills for effective teamwork and technical report writing

Attendees will gain hands-on experience as part of a team working on a
real-world problem posed by an industry partner. Potential industry partners
can also [contact us](#contact) to learn more or propose projects.

The Gala and final presentations for the M2PI 2021 projects will take place on
August 26th at 12/1 - 3/4 (Pacific/Mountain). Please [contact us](#contact) for
connection details to join us for this event.
