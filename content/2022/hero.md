**July 11-29, 2022**

In July 2022 PIMS held a virtual workshop called Math to Power Industry (M2PI
2022) for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the mathematical and
statistical sciences to gain the industry skills necessary for success in their
careers.

The workshop had two main objectives

1. To build technical skills in programming and computational workflows
1. To build business skills for effective teamwork and technical report writing

Attendees gained hands on experience as part of a team, working on a real-world
problem posed by an industry partner.
