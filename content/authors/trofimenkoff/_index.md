Elizabeth is a graduate student at the University of Lethbridge. Elizabeth's
Master's work included analyzing a series of biochemical models related to
glioblastoma cell survival, which resulted in the proposal of several potential
chemotherapeutic targets within a specific non-canonical gene expression system.
In addition to this work, Elizabeth has also worked on developing a scaling
algorithm to identify conditions that validate the steady-state approximation in
various chemical and biochemical systems. Elizabeth has analyzed a number of
different gene expression systems during her studies which lead to a publication
entitled "Small binding-site clearance delays are not negligible in gene
expression modeling" in which the behavioural dynamics in models both with and
without clearance delays were elucidated and compared. Elizabeth has interests
in graph theory, bifurcation analysis, and numerical analysis, among others.
Elizabeth enjoys interacting with, learning from, and educating other members of
both the scientific and non-scientific communities.
