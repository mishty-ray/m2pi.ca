Trevor Tombe is a Professor of Economics at the University of Calgary and a
Research Fellow at The School of Public Policy. Prior to joining the University
of Calgary in 2012, I was an Assistant Professor of Economics at Wilfrid Laurier
University. My academic research explores a broad range of topics, but focuses
mainly on international trade, macroeconomics, and fiscal federalism questions.
In addition to this work, I actively contribute to public policy research and
outreach in Alberta and Canada.
