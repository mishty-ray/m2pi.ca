I received a Ph.D. in Mathematics in January 2020 from Shiraz University of
Technology, Iran and am currently a PIMs postdoctoral fellow at University of
Lethbridge, Canada. My research interests mainly revolve around convex and
non-convex optimization problems, machine learning, quantum, and interior point
methods.
