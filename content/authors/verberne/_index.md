Yvon received her PhD in 2020 from the University of Toronto, where she is
currently a postdoctoral scholar. She has also held postdoctoral positions at
MSRI, ICERM, and Georgia Institute of Technology. Her research interests lie at
the intersection of low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory, where
she mainly focuses on studying mapping class groups of finite type and infinite
type surfaces. Yvon is also interested in machine learning and its application
to theoretical mathematics and real world problems.
