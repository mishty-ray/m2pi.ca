I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the University of Regina. I work in
algebraic combinatorics, which is useful for treating problems in coding and
design theory. In particular, my PhD dissertation is based on studying different
association schemes, checking them for fusion-primitivity and classifying their
nontrivial fusions.
