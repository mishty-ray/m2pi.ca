I'm a PhD student at the University of Toronto working in representation theory.
I'm at the end of my degree and transitioning into data science. I work on math
modelling problems in my spare time, from modelling network flows with linear
algebra to implementing a simulation of orbital dynamics. I enjoy having variety
in the problems I work on, and building the programming skills needed to work in
disparate domains.
