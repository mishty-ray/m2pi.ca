Zachary has a MSc in Physics from the University of Calgary, and previously
led the data science department at a start-up. A typical day at Cybera
involves helping teach Albertans about data science, or helping build data
science solutions for Alberta companies (and showing them how their data
can work for them). If he's not at his desk, you will find him biking along
the Bow River. The one place heâ€™d most like to travel to is London, UK, to
see his family.
