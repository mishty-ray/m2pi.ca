I recently graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC) with my
Master of Science in Mathematics. My primary area of research is geometric
analysis with a strong focus on the analysis. I am interested in learning more
about data science and machine learning, and how they can be used with
mathematics to solve real world problems.
