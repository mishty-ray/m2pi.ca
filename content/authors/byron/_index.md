Byron graduated from the University of Calgary with a PhD in Biochemistry. His
studies focused on intrinsic properties of proteins, and today he applies the
same scientific principles to data and network-enabled projects. As a burgeoning
data scientist, Byron is interested in the intersection of data analysis and
storytelling, and how numbers can inform on every level of society: from
networks and the environment, to the health issues we could potentially face.
