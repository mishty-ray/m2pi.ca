I got my PhD in Applied Mathematics from the Faculty of Sciences, Ibn Zohr
University. My specialty is Control Theory.I am a research trainee at Ibn Zohr
University. My research interests focus on investigating the asymptotic behavior
of a large class of linear partial differential equations in infinite dimension
spaces. I am also interested in areas of machine learning control.
