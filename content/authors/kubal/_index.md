I'm a Mathematics graduate student at UBC, Vancouver. I'm passionate about
applied mathematics & scientific computing, and am interested in working on
inverse problems as they apply to imaging and sensor systems. I'm currently
working on matrix estimation problems in Spatial Transcriptomics. My past
experiences include Photoelasticity measurements in tissues, optical
simulations for Diffraction Tomography, and Computational Hyperspectral
Imaging.
