I am currently a Thesis based MSc. student at University of Calgary working on
research related to Anomaly Detection in Finance using Graph Methods. I have a
BSc. Statistics from University of Calgary, minoring in Data Science and a BSc.
Mathematics from MacEwan University, minoring in Economics. In my professional
life I have worked primarily in Finance performing Quantitative Research in Data
Science roles, but I am open to roles in any domain. Currently I am working on
improving my MLOps skills to improve my skills in deploying and monitoring
models in production. If you would like to discuss a role or just have a chat,
