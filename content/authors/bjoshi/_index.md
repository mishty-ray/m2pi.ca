Babhru Joshi received the B.S. degree in mathematics and physics from the
University of Maryland, Baltimore County, MD, USA, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree
in computational and applied mathematics from Rice University, Houston, TX, USA,
in 2019. He is currently a PIMS Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of
Mathematics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. His current
research interests include analyzing convex and non-convex formulations for
signal recovery problems with deep generative neural network structural prior,
and providing a theoretical recovery guarantee using ideas and results from high
dimensional geometry and high dimensional probability.
