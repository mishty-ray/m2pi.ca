I am currently a M.Sc. student at the University of Manitoba studying graph
processes on random networks. In the past I have worked on projects involving
the burning number of graphs, the chromatic number of great circle graphs, and
finding Betti splittings of symbolic powers of edge ideals of complete graphs.
My main field of interest is graph theory, with a focus on algorithmic
approaches to problems of graph processes.
