Rafael is a Phd in Applied Science with mention In mathematical Ingineering from
Universidad de Concepción(Chile). Rafael's Thesis's work included numerical
analysis treatment for two kind of different problem: The multiclass
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (MCLWR) traffic model which discontinuous flux
function on unknown and Predator-Prey model which incorporates chemotaxis
phenomena. In addition to my dissertation research, other areas that interest me
for my future research stem from my goal of developing improved numerical and
mathematical models.
