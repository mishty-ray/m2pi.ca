I received a Ph.D. in Mathematics in November 2021 from Thapar Institute of
Engineering and Technology, India and am currently working as a postdoctoral
fellow at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India. My research interests
mainly revolve around partial differential equations, wavelets, uncertainty
quantification, numerical analysis and mathematical biology. I am also
interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science.
Besides this, I am proficient in MATLAB and familiar with Python.
