I have a Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from the University of Saskatchewan, and my
advisor is Jenna Rajchgot. I had a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics
from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria, and two masterâ€™s
degrees in Mathematics; one from the African Institute for Mathematical
Sciences, South Africa (AIMS) affiliated with the Department of Mathematics &
Applied Mathematics, University of Cape Town, and the other from the Department
of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Saskatchewan, under the supervision
of Murray Bremner. I am passionate about Mathematics; I love it and I'd like to
be better at it. Currently seeking a postdoctoral position.
