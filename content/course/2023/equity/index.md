### Description
Socio-cultural factors such as globalization, immigration and differences in
cultural identity mean we are likely to be employed in more demographically
diverse workplaces. Diversity in race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, age,
religion, disability and sexual orientation play a significant role in shaping
an individualâ€™s values, experiences, and world perceptions and influencing how
an individual interacts with others. While our differences contribute to rich
and innovative thinking, they can also be a source of conflict when diversity is
not managed effectively. To thrive in diverse environments, we must engage in
self-reflection, unpack terms such as equity, diversity and inclusion and create
equal access to participation and opportunity in our workplaces for all
individuals. This workshop, led by Lorena Solis and co-facilitator Samantha
Jones, is intended to create a safe and courageous space in which we can:

  1. Learn how to define equity, diversity and inclusion.
  1. Engage in meaningful and critical dialogues about challenges that arise in
     diverse environments.
  1. Explore solutions for creating more diverse and inclusive spaces.
