title: "Python Training in Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-Learn"
authors: 
  - iana

summary: |
  Participants will be trained in the use of [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and
  [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). This course will serve as a foundation
  for further courses on machine learning (e.g. sklearn) which will in turn
  provide participants with a solid general purpose toolset for
  data-analysis and developing data-science pipelines for practical problems.

### Course Description
This course will build on your knowledge of Python to sharpen your skills for
data manipulation and analysis. We will assume that you have gone through the
material in our [self study
repository](https://github.com/ianabc/m2pi-python-self-study) before this course.

We will use Jupyter notebooks to explore foundational data-science libraries
such as [numpy](https://numpy.org), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org). We will explore how to use these libraries
to create performant python code and then use them to tidy real world datasets
and extract insights from them. 

At the end of the course you should feel comfortable working with unfamiliar
datasets, fixing common data errors, creating visualizations to understand your
data, and extracting insights from models.
