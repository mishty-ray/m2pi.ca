title: "Mathematical modelling and carbon pricing"
authors:  [olien]

summary: | 
  A mathematical model is a quantitative construct that interacts between a
  concept and data. Models range from exceedingly simple to incredibly complex.
  To understand the essential concepts around carbon prices, I will present
  background on markets for carbon in general, how they are created and the
  unique features of the GHG emission reduction regime in Alberta. We will then
  investigate what data is available to help develop a model for carbon prices.

### Description

A mathematical model is a quantitative construct that interacts between a concept and data. Models range from exceedingly simple to incredibly complex. To understand the essential concepts around carbon prices, I will present background on markets for carbon in general, how they are created and the unique features of the GHG emission reduction regime in Alberta. We will then investigate what data is available to help develop a model for carbon prices.
