### Description
Julia is a high-level programming language well suited for scientific computing
and data science. Just-in-time compilation, among other things, makes Julia
really fast yet interactive. For heavy computations, Julia supports
multi-threaded and multi-process parallelism, both natively and via a number of
external packages. It also supports memory arrays distributed across multiple
processes either on the same or different nodes. In this hands-on workshop, we
will start with a quick review of Juliaâ€™s multi-threading features but will
focus primarily on Distributed standard library and its large array of tools. We
will demo parallelization using two problems: a slowly converging series and a
Julia set. We will run examples on a multi-core laptop and an HPC cluster.
