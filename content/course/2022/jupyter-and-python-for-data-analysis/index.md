title: "Python Training in Numpy and Pandas"
authors: [iana]

summary: |
  Participants will be trained in the use of [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and
  [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) python libraries. Together these
  libraries form the foundation of most Python data-analysis and data-science
  pipelines.

### Course Description
This course will build on your knowledge of Python to sharpen your skills for
data manipulation and analysis. We will use libraries such as pandas, numpy 
to ingest, tidy and explore real world datasets and extract insights from them.
We will leverage the Jupyter notebook interface to help us work with public
APIs, combine multiple datasets and perform exploratory analysis. At the end of
the course you should feel comfortable working with unfamiliar datasets,
spotting common data errors and using visualizations to understand your data and
plan more detailed analysis.
