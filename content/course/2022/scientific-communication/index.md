### Description
As a graduate student, you likely are focused on taking a range of courses in
advanced methods, being able to form good research questions and perhaps
developing your teaching skills. These technical and theoretical skills are
important, but comprise about half of the skills you will need in any job.
Developing strong “soft skills” – those that involve personal attributes and
competencies – are critical to working in a health research setting. In this
presentation, I will describe typical activities and skills needed in my
research position, and suggestions for how you can obtain and polish these
skills as a graduate student.
