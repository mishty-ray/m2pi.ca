### Overview

Demand for clean fuels (e.g., ethanol, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation
fuel) is set to grow rapidly as new government regulations mandate fuel carbon
intensity and volumetric blending requirements. Industry needs to know where
biogenic feedstocks may be sourced and what the corresponding carbon intensity
of these fuel pathways may be in order to meet compliance obligations and
minimize compliance costs. This project will consist of data exploration to
better understand large feedstock sources and possible fuel supply-chains that
maximize carbon intensity reductions and minimize life cycle fuel supply costs.
