summary: |
  [Principal Component Analysis
  (PCA)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2015.0202%29), as
  well as Factor Analysis, are a couple of techniques used to increase data
  value by making data more interpretable while simultaneously preserving as
  much variability and information possible . Given large topic-indexed datasets
  reflecting activity by parliamentarians such as chamber interventions,
  committee interventions, bills, motions, and chamber votes how might such
  analytical techniques be used to reduce the dimensionality of these sets while
  increasing their interpretability?  Can useful and efficient graphical
  displays for the public be generated through the application of such
  techniques to political data? What other types of data analysis methods may be
  used alongside such techniques to extract meaning from political data? What
  measures of similitude or difference between individual politicians or parties
  might be derived? How might such features help to measure political
  performance? How can topic indexes be aggregated to reflect similarities in
  political concern?

### Situation
Big data analytics are changing the way in which sports are played and
understood, resulting in improved performance and increased fan engagement. Can
a similar virtuous data cycle be applied to political games to increase
understanding of political performance and improve citizen engagement?


### Mission
Apply mathematical, statistical, computational, and visualization tools to
political data to help improve fact-based political storytelling for mass media
and social media contexts.

### Relevant Skills
Python, data visualization tools such as https://d3js.org/ and PowerBI, some
familiarity with cloud computing environment such as AWS, data analysis.
https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5 knowledge could be an asset.

### Data & Metadata
Data & Metadata: RapidAPI – (data links to be provided) Datasets provided to
support this problem are proprietary Goverlytics datasets extracted from
Canadian and USA legislatures.

### Problem Statement
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as well as Factor Analysis, are a couple of
techniques used to increase data value by making data more interpretable while
simultaneously preserving as much variability and information possible
(https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2015.0202). Given large
topic-indexed datasets reflecting activity by parliamentarians such as chamber
interventions, committee interventions, bills, motions, and chamber votes how
might such analytical techniques be used to reduce the dimensionality of these
sets while increasing their interpretability ?  Can useful and efficient
graphical displays for the public be generated through the application of such
techniques to political data? What other types of data analysis methods may be
used alongside such techniques to extract meaning from political data? What
measures of similitude or difference between individual politicians or parties
might be derived? How might such features help to measure political performance?
How can topic indexes be aggregated to reflect similarities in political concern
?

### Data Storytelling Pro Tips
Five components are key to storytelling: characters, setting, plot, conflict,
and resolution. These essential elements engage your audience.  When telling
stories with data, use a story framework: have data to describe characters
(parliamentarians in our case), threats (poor policy?), goals (better
policies?), changes (how are things may be evolving over time).
