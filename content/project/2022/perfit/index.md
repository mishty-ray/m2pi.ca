title: Perfit
subtitle: Measuring Performance of Green Stormwater Infrastructure

summary: |
  Perfit is currently working on a virtual fitting room app that allows online
  shoppers to get a virtual preview of the fit of garments in their cart. The
  virtual fit is accomplished via simulations of cloth interacting with a
  customer avatar through particle collisions. Specifically, each piece of cloth
  is modeled using a mesh of interconnected particles. The company has made
  progress on collisions between cloth and avatar. However, there is a need for
  collisions between cloth and cloth that has remained a significant challenge
  for the company. For example, the capability for a virtual garment to interact
  with itself via cloth-on-cloth collision would allow improved wrinkle quality,
  and garments with pleats, such as a pleated skirt. The technical challenge
  facing the company is to enable the handling of cloth-on-cloth collisions in
  near real time. In a mathematical sense, an algorithm for cloth-on-cloth
  collisions would need to be developed that minimizes the number of operations
  required (e.g., avoids brute force particle searches) while maintaining
  sufficient accuracy.

  Topics in geometry, physics, computational methods, and computer graphics are
  expected to arise while working on this problem. The preferred implementation
  of the solution is the Fortran programming language in order to facilitate
  integration with the existing physics engine. During the workshop, meshes for
  both customer avatar and cloth will be made available through GitHub for
  testing.
